### :woman_technologist: About Me :

My name is Amina, and I am a beginner manual tester. Currently, I work as a graphic designer, but I have always had an interest in the technical side of software development <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

My experience in graphic design has taught me to be detail-oriented and strive for high quality in my work. I have also developed analytical thinking and the ability to organize information systematically. Although I do not have direct experience in manual testing, I am eager to learn and willing to do whatever it takes to become a qualified tester

I am open to new challenges and ready to embrace any opportunity that will help me expand my knowledge and experience :heart_on_fire::heart_on_fire::heart_on_fire:
